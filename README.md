# Data Wrangling and Analysis- WeRateDogs Twitter Dataset
### Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree- Project 2

## Introduction
This is a comprehensive data wrangling and analysis of the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. The dataset used for this analysis was gathered from three different sources. 

The datasets and their sources are highlighted below
1. `Twitter-archive-enhanced-csv` - Gotten by downloading the `csv.` file
2. `image-predictions-tsv`- Gathered from the URL link using the `request.get` library
3. `tweet.json`- Gathered from querying the Twitter API. 
These files were loaded into the Jupyter notebook for analysis.

This repository contains two pdf files titled `wrangle_report.pdf` and `act_report.pdf` which contains the brief report of my wrangling process and the plots from the juyter notebook respectively. 
The `wrangle_act.ipynb` file is the  jupyter notebook containing the codes and the workflow detailing the analysis.

The datasets gathered have also been added to the repository.
